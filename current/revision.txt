Review 1:
1. Why do we use direct proofs (SAT, QSAT), instead of NCL? Mention in paragraph with 2.3
* 2. Paragraph "We add ..." in introduction was repeated.
3. Standardize section heads, don't cram, apppendix.
4. Why is this system interesting? Mention reversible (while we prove results for a mix of systems,
   all the proofs are in a reversible setting - we ignore any non-reversible options).
Review 2:
1. Table: What is storage? What is sliding? Remove blocks column, since it's always the same.
Jayson 2. Small "automata-style" summaries of possible state transitions of the major gadgets.
Isaac 3. Summarize the reduction targets - put all the gadgets together, explain in detail why it works.
4. Add in more formal language, especially in 2D proof, stuff like "leaking into the other line".
5. Figure 1: Mention red blocks are movable, label them for later reference.
6. Figure 3: Show the situation after setting the variable, to make it clear what the point
   of the diagram is.
7. Figure 6: Mention 3D in caption.
8. Mention why we need crossovers, instead of using planar 3D. The clauses don't work without crossovers.
Review 3:
1. More references (see review)
General:
1. Introduction had many comments - detailed recheck.
2. 2D gadgets are old and not very formal - detailed recheck.
