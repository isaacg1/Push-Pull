The family considered includes a motion planning problem which forms the basis of a popular computer game called SOKOBAN. The decision problem corresponding to SOKOBAN is shown to be NP-hard. The motion planning problems considered are related to the ''warehouseman's problem'' considered by Hopcroft, Schwartz and Sharir, and to geometric versions of the motion planning problem on graphs considered by Papadimitriou, Raghavan, Sudan and Tamaki."},

  abstract = {
In the computer game `Lemmings', the player must guide a tribe of green-haired
lemming creatures to safety, and save them from an untimely demise. 
We formulate the decision problem which is, given a level of the game, to
decide whether it is possible to complete the level (and hence to find 
a solution to that level).  
Under certain limitations, this can be decided in polynomial
time, but in general the problem is shown to be NP-Hard.  
This can hold even if there
is only a single lemming to save, thus showing that it is hard to
approximate the number of saved lemmings to any factor.}
